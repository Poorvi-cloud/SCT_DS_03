## ðŸ§  Objective

To build and evaluate a **Decision Tree Classifier** that predicts if a client will purchase a product (subscribe to a term deposit) based on various customer attributes.

## ðŸ›  Tools & Libraries

- Python
- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- matplotlib, seaborn

## ðŸ“Œ Key Steps

1. Data loading and exploration
2. Preprocessing (label encoding categorical data)
3. Train-test split
4. Model building using `DecisionTreeClassifier`
5. Model evaluation (accuracy, confusion matrix, classification report)
6. Tree visualization & feature importance analysis
